# Machine-Learning-Model-Deployment-with-Azure-and-PyCaret

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to developing, deploying, and retrieving machine learning models using Microsoft Azure Blob Storage and PyCaret. It consists of two main sections:

## 1. Model Development
In this section, we focus on building and optimizing a machine learning model using PyCaretâ€”a low-code machine learning library. The main steps and tools used include:

**Skills and Techniques:**
- Machine Learning Model Development
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Model Selection and Optimization

**Tools and Libraries:**
- PyCaret: An open-source, Python-based library for end-to-end machine learning automation.

### Instructions for Model Development
**1. Installation of Accessory Libraries:**
- We begin by installing the necessary libraries and dependencies. Specifically, we install PyCaret and other libraries required for Azure Blob Storage interaction.

**2. Model Training and Optimization:**
- We use the 'diamond' dataset as an example and load it using PyCaret's get_data function.
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering are performed as part of the setup.
- We create a LightGBM model, optimize its hyperparameters using PyCaret's tune_model function, and finalize the model for deployment.

**3. Deployment of the Model:**
- The final machine learning model is deployed to Microsoft Azure Blob Storage, enabling us to use it for predictions in future applications.


## 2. Model Retrieval and Prediction
In this section, we delve into the process of retrieving a previously deployed machine learning model from Azure Blob Storage and utilizing it for making predictions on new data. The primary skills and tools employed are as follows:

**Skills and Techniques:** 

- Model Retrieval
- Data Preparation for Prediction
- Model Loading and Deployment

**Tools and Libraries:**
- PyCaret: For model loading and prediction
- Azure Blob Storage: For storing and retrieving the deployed model

### Instructions for Model Retrieval and Prediction
**1. Installation of Accessory Libraries:**
- We install the necessary libraries, including PyCaret, for model retrieval and prediction.

**2. Establishing Connection to Azure Blob Storage:**
- You are required to provide your Azure Blob Storage connection string and specify the container and model names. This establishes the connection to your Azure storage account.

**3. Model Retrieval:**
- The model previously deployed to Azure Blob Storage is downloaded to your local environment using the provided connection details.

**4. New Data Preparation and Prediction:**
- We demonstrate how to prepare new data for prediction using PyCaret and utilize the retrieved model to make predictions on this fresh dataset.

**Usage**
- To replicate the model development and retrieval process, follow the detailed instructions provided in each section of the code. Be sure to replace the Azure connection string and container/model names with your specific Azure Blob Storage information.

**Prerequisites**
Before you can successfully use this repository, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
